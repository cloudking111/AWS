1. Compute Services
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
EC2 provides resizable virtual servers in the cloud. It offers a wide variety of instance types optimized for CPU, memory, storage, or GPU-intensive workloads. You pay per second or hour, depending on instance type.

Instance Types: General Purpose (t3, m5), Compute Optimized (c5), Memory Optimized (r5), GPU Instances (p3, g4).
Pricing Models: On-Demand, Reserved Instances (1 or 3 years), Spot Instances (interruptible, low cost), Dedicated Hosts.
Key Features: Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing, Elastic IPs, Security Groups.
Example Use Case: Hosting scalable web applications, batch processing, high-performance computing.
AWS Lambda
Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers — serverless compute. You pay only for the compute time consumed.

Supported Languages: Node.js, Python, Java, C#, Go, Ruby, custom runtimes.
Triggers: API Gateway, S3 events, DynamoDB streams, CloudWatch Events, and more.
Use Cases: Backend for web/mobile apps, real-time file processing, IoT data handling.
Tip: Combine Lambda with API Gateway to build scalable RESTful APIs.
Amazon Elastic Beanstalk
A platform as a service (PaaS) that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without worrying about infrastructure.

Supports: Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, Docker.
Features: Auto Scaling, load balancing, health monitoring.
Ideal for: Rapid deployment of web applications and services.
Amazon ECS & EKS
Managed container orchestration services.

ECS (Elastic Container Service): Highly scalable Docker container management.
EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service): Managed Kubernetes cluster service.
Fargate: Serverless compute engine for containers — no server management needed.
Use Cases: Microservices, containerized applications.
AWS Batch
Fully managed batch computing service to run large-scale parallel and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads.

AWS Outposts
Extends AWS infrastructure and services to on-premises locations for hybrid cloud environments.

2. Storage Services

Use Cases: Backup and restore, static website hosting, big data analytics, media hosting.
Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)
Persistent block storage volumes for use with EC2 instances.

Volume Types: General Purpose SSD (gp3/gp2), Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1/io2), Throughput Optimized HDD (st1), Cold HDD (sc1).
Use Cases: Boot volumes, databases, enterprise applications requiring consistent low latency.
Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)
Scalable file storage for use with Linux-based workloads.

Use Cases: Content management, web serving, data sharing across multiple EC2 instances.
Features: Scales automatically, supports NFS protocol, multi-AZ replication for availability.
Amazon FSx
Fully managed Windows or Lustre file systems optimized for specific workloads.

AWS Storage Gateway
Hybrid storage service connecting on-premises software appliances with cloud-based storage.

3. Database Services
Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)
Managed relational database service supporting several engines including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and Amazon Aurora.

Features: Automated backups, Multi-AZ for high availability, read replicas for scaling.
Use Cases: Traditional transactional applications.
Amazon Aurora
High-performance, MySQL- and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database designed for the cloud.

Advantages: Up to 5x faster than standard MySQL, fully managed, fault tolerant.
Amazon DynamoDB
Fully managed, serverless NoSQL database with key-value and document data models.

Features: Single-digit millisecond latency, auto scaling, global tables.
Use Cases: Gaming, IoT, mobile apps requiring low latency.
Amazon ElastiCache
In-memory data store and cache supporting Redis and Memcached.

Amazon Neptune
Fully managed graph database service for highly connected datasets.

Amazon DocumentDB
Managed document database service compatible with MongoDB workloads.

Amazon Timestream
Fast, scalable time-series database service for IoT and operational applications.

4. Networking & Content Delivery
Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
Create isolated virtual networks, define subnets, route tables, gateways, and security settings.

Features: Public and private subnets, NAT gateways, VPC peering, VPN connections.
Tip: Use private subnets for sensitive workloads and route traffic through NAT gateways.
Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
Automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets like EC2 instances, containers, or IP addresses.

Types: Application Load Balancer (HTTP/HTTPS), Network Load Balancer (TCP/UDP), Gateway Load Balancer.
Use Cases: High availability, fault tolerance, scaling web applications.
Amazon Route 53
Highly available DNS service that translates domain names to IP addresses.

Features: DNS routing, health checks, traffic policies, domain registration.
Tip: Use latency-based routing to direct users to the closest endpoint.
